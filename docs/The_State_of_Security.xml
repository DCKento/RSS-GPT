<div> CherryBlos, Android malware, cryptocurrency accounts, photos, sensitive information <br />
Summary: 
CherryBlos is a family of Android malware that can steal cryptocurrency by accessing sensitive information stored in the user's photo gallery. The malware is designed to extract details related to cryptocurrency wallets from photos stored on the Android device. The concept is that if a user inadvertently stores images containing sensitive information, such as cryptocurrency wallet details, the malware can access and use that information to steal cryptocurrency from the victim's accounts. This highlights the importance of keeping sensitive information secure and not storing it in easily accessible locations on mobile devices. This also serves as a cautionary reminder to be vigilant about the security of personal devices and the potential risks of malware and cyber attacks targeting cryptocurrency users. <div>
