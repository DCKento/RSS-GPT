<title>Noticing command and control channels by reviewing DNS protocols, (Mon, Nov 13th)</title>

<div> Keywords: Malicious software, DNS lookup, connection, Network Detection and Response (NDR) tool, network traffic

Summary:
Malicious software can communicate with external servers by performing DNS lookups or initiating connections without DNS lookup. This latter behavior is abnormal and can be detected by Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools that analyze network traffic over a period of at least two weeks. The malware "calling home" through a direct connection without DNS lookup is a red flag for cybersecurity professionals. By reviewing network traffic, NDR tools can identify these abnormal connection attempts and flag them for further investigation. This proactive approach helps organizations detect and respond to potential threats before they can cause significant damage. Therefore, it is crucial for businesses to invest in and utilize NDR tools to fortify their network security and protect against sophisticated malicious software. <div>
Malicious software pieces installed in computers call home. Some of them can be noticed because they perform DNS lookup and some of them initiates connection without DNS lookup. For this last option, this is abnormal and can be noticed by any Network Detection and Response (NDR) tool that reviews the network traffic by at least two weeks.

Code injection techniques (T1055 from MITRE[1]) is a common technique these days. It&rsquo;s a nice way for an attacker to hide malicious code into a legit process. A deviation of this technique is called &ldquo;Process Hollowing&rdquo;[2] where code of the legit suspended process is wiped and replaced by malicious code. Code injection is performed by calling Microsoft API calls like: VirtualAllocEx(), NtUnmapViewOfSecrio(), WriteProcessMemory(), ... (they are many others available)

<title>What's Normal: New uses of DNS, Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR), (Tue, Nov 7th)</title>

Collecting and analyzing DNS logs should be at the top of your agenda regarding network monitoring. Everything that happens on the network tends to be reflected in DNS, and events that do not correlate with DNS are often suspect themselves. For example, if a host connects to an IP address directly without first receiving it as a DNS response. But in recent years, DNS has moved more and more to encrypted channels. Starting with DNS over TLS (DoT), DNS&nbsp;over HTTPS (DoH), and lately DNS over QUIC (DoQ).
