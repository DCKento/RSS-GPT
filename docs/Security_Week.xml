<div> Ransomware, data extortion, RansomedVC, shut down, sell<br>
Summary:<br>
The ransomware and data extortion group RansomedVC has announced its plan to shut down the project and sell parts of its infrastructure. This decision comes after the group has been involved in various cybercrimes. RansomedVC is known for attacking organizations and extorting money by encrypting their data and demanding payments in return for decryption keys. The group's actions have caused significant financial losses and disruptions to businesses and institutions. By selling off its infrastructure, RansomedVC aims to potentially transfer its operations to other threat actors. This move raises concerns about the potential impact on the cybersecurity landscape as other malicious groups could acquire and repurpose the infrastructure for their own illicit activities. It is essential for organizations and law enforcement agencies to remain vigilant and take proactive measures to combat such cyber threats. <br><br> <div>
