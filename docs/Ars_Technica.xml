<div> spectrum, reallocated, wireless broadband, satellites, drones
Summary:
The Biden administration is considering reallocating 2,786 megahertz of spectrum for various purposes including wireless broadband networks, satellites, and drones. The spectrum bands being studied are a mix of Federal and shared Federal/non-Federal bands, with an emphasis on mid-band frequencies. The plan includes five spectrum bands for in-depth study in the near term, exploring their potential for expanded governmental and non-governmental use for advanced applications and services in terrestrial wireless broadband, innovative space services, and unmanned aviation and autonomous vehicle operations. This updated national strategy may speed up the processes already being investigated by federal agencies, with the goal of facilitating the use of spectrum for next-generation technologies. <br><br>Summary: <div>

<div> Google, Apple, search deal, revenue, trial <br>
Summary: 
During the Department of Justice's monopoly trial, it was revealed that Google pays 36 percent of its search advertising revenue from Safari to keep its search engine as the default in Apple's browser. This detail was a closely held secret and both Google and Apple objected to its public disclosure. The revelation came from Google's main economics expert, Kevin Murphy, during the trial. This arrangement highlights the significant value of the default search deal to Google and sheds light on the behind-the-scenes negotiations between tech giants. This information came to light as part of the ongoing examination of Google's search business, with the trial providing insights into the inner workings of these major players in the tech industry. The disclosure of this key detail is likely to have significant implications for the future of the search engine market and the relationships between major technology companies. <br> <div>

<p>SpaceX launched its ninth "Transporter" mission on Saturday from California, carrying dozens of small- and medium-sized satellites into low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>The upside of these launches for customers is that they can rely on regular, low-cost access to space aboard the reliable Falcon 9 rocket. The downside is that the satellites are all released into a basic orbit, and if they want to reach a different altitude or inclination, they have to bring their own propulsion along for the ride.</p>
<p>This has led to the advent of "last mile" services from various companies offering small add-on spacecraft capable of providing in-space propulsion. One of the most intriguing of these is Impulse Space, a company founded two years ago by rocket scientist Tom Mueller, who was a founding employee at SpaceX before leaving in 2020.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983306#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983306&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Monday, Nvidia <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-supercharges-hopper-the-worlds-leading-ai-computing-platform">announced</a> the HGX <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/h200/">H200</a> Tensor Core GPU, which utilizes the Hopper architecture to accelerate AI applications. It's a follow-up of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/hopper-time-nvidias-most-powerful-ai-chip-yet-ships-in-october/">H100 GPU</a>, released last year and previously Nvidia's most powerful AI GPU chip. If widely deployed, it could lead to far more powerful AI models—and faster response times for existing ones like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/">ChatGPT</a>—in the near future.</p>
<p>According to experts, lack of computing power (often called "compute") has been a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/06/tech/ai-chips-supply-chain/index.html">major bottleneck</a> of AI progress this past year, hindering deployments of existing AI models and slowing the development of new ones. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/openai-may-jump-into-ai-hardware-amid-high-costs-supply-constraints/">Shortages</a> of powerful GPUs that accelerate AI models are largely to blame. One way to alleviate the compute bottleneck is to make more chips, but you can also make AI chips more powerful. That second approach may make the H200 an attractive product for cloud providers.</p>

<p>What's the H200 good for? Despite the "G" in the "GPU" name, data center GPUs like this typically aren't for graphics. GPUs are ideal for AI applications because they perform vast numbers of parallel matrix multiplications, which are necessary for neural networks to function. They are essential in the training portion of building an AI model and the "inference" portion, where people feed inputs into an AI model and it returns results.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983396#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983396&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

<title>Tesla threatened to sue buyers who resell Cybertruck without written permission</title>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>With Tesla's first Cybertruck deliveries expected later this month, a now-deleted update to the electric carmaker's terms of service said the firm could sue customers for $50,000 or more if they resell during the first year of ownership without first getting written permission from Tesla. The provision seemed designed to deter scalping for a car expected to be available only in limited quantities after CEO Elon Musk's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/elon-musk-talks-tesla-we-dug-our-own-grave-with-the-cybertruck/">statement</a> that Tesla "dug our own grave with the Cybertruck."</p>
<p>But the clause was deleted from Tesla's terms just days after people noticed its appearance. It was still in the Tesla <a href="https://www.tesla.com/configurator/api/v3/terms?locale=en_US&amp;model=my&amp;saleType=Sale">Motor Vehicle Order Agreement Terms &amp; Conditions</a> earlier today, but was removed from the document while we worked on this article. The document still has a more general rule against quick resales but without the lawsuit threat.</p>
<p>Tesla may have decided to remove the clause after several news reports spread word of the change over the weekend. It's not clear whether the company will bring the clause back in a modified form. We contacted Tesla and will update this article if we get a response.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983454#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983454&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

<p class="p1">The Ryzen 7000 desktop CPU series was AMD’s first to include a small integrated GPU by default to make the chips more appealing for budget and business desktops where a dedicated GPU would be overkill. These bare-bones GPUs won't play many games, as we found <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/ryzen-7600x-and-7950x-review-zen-4-starts-off-expensive-but-impressive/5/#h2">when we tested them</a>, but they're a reliable way to light up a couple of monitors.</p>
<p>AMD said at the time that it also planned to continue making desktop APUs, the company's longstanding terminology for a Ryzen CPU paired with a more powerful integrated Radeon GPU, but we haven't heard anything about a new Ryzen desktop APU since. That could be changing early next year, according to the release notes for <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/2123">a slew of BIOS updates for Gigabyte motherboards</a>. According to Gigabyte, a new series of APUs for socket AM5 motherboards will be released starting in January 2024, and they'll be compatible with any current socket AM5 motherboard running version 1.1.0.0 or newer of AMD's AGESA firmware.</p>
<p>Tom's Hardware has <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/gigabyte-releases-Ryzen-8000G-supporting-BIOS">a breakdown</a> of the Ryzen 8000G series, purportedly gleaned from this new AGESA version. According to this, the chips will be named the Ryzen 8000G series, and they'll use the same "Phoenix" silicon that AMD uses in its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/amd-is-ready-to-launch-its-twice-delayed-ryzen-7000-chips-for-lightweight-laptops/">Ryzen 7040U laptop processors</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/amds-ryzen-z1-chips-could-power-a-new-wave-of-handheld-steam-deck-clones/">Ryzen Z1 series</a> of chips for gaming handhelds.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983286#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983286&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

<p>After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/zelle-fraud-is-on-the-rise-and-many-victims-are-denied-refunds/">scammers spent years swiping hundreds of millions from Zelle users</a> by inducing people to authorize fraudulent payments, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/reports/new-report-by-senator-warren-zelle-facilitating-fraud-based-on-internal-data-from-big-banks">lawmakers were horrified</a> to discover in fall 2022 that "the vast majority" of defrauded Zelle users never got their money back. To regulators, it seemed like Zelle was shirking responsibility for policing this increasingly common fraudulent activity on its payments platform.</p>
<p>But now, Zelle has changed its mind and is working harder to protect users from imposter scams. On Monday, Zelle confirmed that at the end of June, the payments app finally started refunding users targeted by scammers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/payments-app-zelle-begins-refunds-imposter-scams-after-washington-pressure-2023-11-13/">According to Reuters</a>, this was possible because Zelle's network operator, Early Warning Services (EWS), found a solution that lets Zelle's network of 2,100 financial firms off the hook for reimbursing transactions where "potentially billions of dollars" might be stolen by imposter scammers. Instead of expecting financial partners to foot the bill to cover this fraudulent activity, Zelle simply "implemented a mechanism that allows banks to claw back funds from the recipient's account and return them to the sender."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983390#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983390&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

<title>Qualcomm kills its copy of Apple’s satellite SOS after ten months</title>

<p>One of the iPhone 14's major new features was "Emergency SOS via satellite." During normal usage, smartphones struggle to connect to something as far away as a satellite, but it's possible to send out tiny bits of data under ideal conditions with the help of an aiming app. Apple turned this into a way to send a message to emergency services even when you're off the grid, and the Android ecosystem immediately set about copying the feature. Qualcomm's "Snapdragon Satellite" was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/qualcomm-says-it-built-a-better-satellite-messaging-system-than-apple/">announced in</a> January 2023, and now, ten months later and with zero customers, the plan is dead.</p>
<p>Qualcomm's satellite partner for the project, Iridium, <a href="https://investor.iridium.com/2023-11-09-Iridium-Announces-New-D2D-Direction">announced</a> the dissolution of the partnership in a press release, though Qualcomm says it still wants to work with Iridium for future projects. Iridium wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Iridium previously announced that it entered into agreements with Qualcomm to enable satellite messaging and emergency services in smartphones powered by Snapdragon Mobile Platforms using Iridium's satellite network. The companies successfully developed and demonstrated the technology; however, notwithstanding this technical success, smartphone manufacturers have not included the technology in their devices. Due to this, on <span class="xn-chron">November 3, 2023</span>, Qualcomm notified Iridium that it has elected to terminate the agreements, effective <span class="xn-chron">December 3, 2023</span>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, the project is dying because Qualcomm couldn't get a single Android manufacturer to add satellite messaging to a phone. Qualcomm's satellite solution didn't require much in the way of new hardware, so the rejection was apparently due to Qualcomm's design of the feature and (presumably) any tack-on fees it was adding to the bill of materials. In a statement given to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/09/iridium-announces-end-of-qualcomm-satellite-to-phone-partnership.html">CNBC</a>, Qualcomm says smartphone makers “indicated a preference towards standards-based solutions” for satellite-to-phone connectivity, a plan the company now wants to pivot to.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983337#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983337&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

<p>Earlier this year, new electric vehicle tax incentive rules went into effect. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, an EV's tax credit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/heres-how-the-irss-clean-vehicle-tax-credit-will-change-on-april-18/">is now linked to the amount of domestic content</a> in its battery pack, an amount that needs to increase year on year.</p>
<p>Automakers had an inkling that would happen, so we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/stellantis-will-open-a-40-gwh-year-battery-plant-in-the-us-in-2024/">seen</a> a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/bmw-will-invest-1-7-billion-to-make-evs-in-the-united-states/">flurry</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/us-government-lends-gm-and-lg-2-5-billion-for-ev-battery-plants/">announcements</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/honda-is-the-latest-automaker-looking-to-build-a-us-battery-factory/">new battery plants</a> in the United States that will make the cells and assemble the packs for future EVs, but we've heard slightly less about new local sources of lithium.

<p>Health officials in Omaha, Nebraska, are wasting no time in testing over 500 infants, toddlers, and children who may have been exposed to an active tuberculosis case at a local daycare. The Douglas County Health Department (DCHD) declared a public health emergency Friday.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.douglascountyhealth.com/images/TB_HAN_2023.pdf">a press release</a>, DCHD said the exposures occurred at a daycare at the Westview YMCA, which provides "drop-in" care, allowing members to drop off their kids as they use the facility. The exposures occurred between May 21, 2023, and October 30, 2023.</p>
<p>Children’s Nebraska pediatric hospital quickly set up a clinic this weekend to test children ages 4 and under who were potentially exposed in the last 10 weeks. Children in this age group need "window prophylaxis" treatment to prevent the development of tuberculosis as testing is underway. Later this week, DCHD will set up a clinic to test children ages 5 and up who were potentially exposed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983356#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983356&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fhr3MzT6exg?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" style="display: block;" type="text/html" width="980"></div><p class="caption" style="font-size: 0.8em;">Zack Snyder and Netflix hope to launch a new franchise with <em>Rebel Moon Part 1: Child of Fire</em>, with Part 2 to release next year. </p></div>
<p>Netflix concluded its Geeked Week showcase yesterday with the release of the full trailer for director Zack Snyder's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Moon">Rebel Moon</a>: A Child of Fire</em>. It's the first of two parts (with plans for a third film to make it a trilogy), and Snyder and the streaming giant hope the films will launch a new space opera franchise. There are already plans for a novelization of the film, a four-issue prequel comic, a narrative podcast, an animated series, and a four-player game for the Netflix gaming platform.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/08/zack-snyder-unveils-extended-teaser-for-his-netflix-sci-fi-saga-rebel-moon/">we reported previously</a>, years ago, director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder">Zack Snyder</a> had an idea for an epic Star Wars movie that he pitched to Lucasfilm. That project never panned out for a variety of reasons. But the idea continued to germinate until Netflix got on board. Apart from Star Wars, Snyder has said his influences include the films of Akira Kurosawa, especially <em>Seven Samurai</em>, and <em>The Dirty Dozen</em>.

<p>Rotary engines have an aura of cool. In games of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Trumps"><em>Top Trumps</em></a>, the V12 might have been king, but a rotary was a joker, a wild card. A lack of mainstream success no doubt contributes; there are reasons they were never commonplace, including their oil-burning apex seals, which created emissions and fuel-consumption headaches.</p>
<p>LiquidPiston thinks it has those problems solved, however, and in the process, it created a new internal combustion engine that's small and efficient. It has demonstrated its tech on the bench and in a go-kart, but also in uncrewed aerial vehicles for the US military.</p>
<p>While little about the rotary engine merits the word, in a "traditional" Wankel rotary, a triangle-shaped rotor turns within a chamber during its combustion cycle. Apex seals are fitted at the apices of the rotor, but they need constant lubrication with oil, plenty of which burns during combustion. So, a Wankel engine needs constant oil top-ups while dealing with the products of that burnt oil. And those apex seals wear down.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983309#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983309&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

<p>The blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drug semaglutide (Wegovy, Ozempic, Rybelsus) reduced the relative risk of heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular deaths by 20 percent in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease but not diabetes during a large and long randomized, placebo-controlled trial.</p>
<p>That overall risk reduction equates to 15 fewer cardiovascular events per 1,000 patients treated. People on semaglutide in the trial lost an average of 9.5 percent of their body weight, an 8.5 percentage-point drop over those in the placebo group.</p>

<p>Over the last two years, Astra has become one of just a handful of the dozens of startup launch companies to actually put something into orbit. This is a measure of the technical acumen of Astra engineers, who set out to execute on the vision of the company's co-founders, Chris Kemp and Adam London.</p>
<p>During the same period, Astra's financials have taken a nose dive. When Astra went public in mid-2021, it had a valuation of $2.6 billion. The company's market value is around $25 million, based on Astra's closing price on the Nasdaq stock exchange.</p>
<p>A week ago, Astra's market value was even lower. The number rose after Astra revealed Thursday that Kemp and London made an offer to take the company private in a bid to save the startup they established in 2016.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983272#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983272&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For the first time, researchers have demonstrated that a large portion of cryptographic keys used to protect data in computer-to-server SSH traffic are vulnerable to complete compromise when naturally occurring computational errors occur while the connection is being established.</p>
<p>Underscoring the importance of their discovery, the researchers used their findings to calculate the private portion of almost 200 unique SSH keys they observed in public Internet scans taken over the past seven years. The researchers suspect keys used in IPsec connections could suffer the same fate. SSH is the cryptographic protocol used in secure shell connections that allows computers to remotely access servers, usually in security-sensitive enterprise environments. IPsec is a protocol used by virtual private networks that route traffic through an encrypted tunnel.</p>
<p>The vulnerability occurs when there are errors during the signature generation that takes place when a client and server are establishing a connection. It affects only keys using the RSA cryptographic algorithm, which the researchers found in roughly a third of the SSH signatures they examined. That translates to roughly 1 billion signatures out of the 3.2 billion signatures examined. Of the roughly 1 billion RSA signatures, about one in a million exposed the private key of the host.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983026#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983026&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light; a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope.

<p>Good morning. It is November 13, and today we're traveling 4.3 billion light-years away from Earth, to a cluster of galaxies known as MACS0416. This distant object, which turns out to be two galaxy clusters that are colliding with one another, was first discovered in images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p>Hubble, of course, brought "deep field" astronomy alive by <a href="https://esahubble.org/science/deep_fields/">publishing images</a> with thousands of galaxies. Now, by combining Hubble observations with the new James Webb Space Telescope, NASA and its partners have produced an even deeper field image. The resulting panchromatic image, which combines visible and infrared light, gives us one of the most comprehensive views of the Universe ever obtained.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982737#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982737&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The takeaway of Robert Sapolsky’s <a href="https://amzn.to/49sPQQv"><i>Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will</i></a> is basically the same as that espoused by those Snickers commercials: You’re not you when you’re hungry. Except according to Sapolsky, there is no “you”—the hunger is what dictates your behavior, along with your stress level, whether or not you were born with fetal alcohol syndrome or grew up in a culture that valorizes individual freedoms versus one that prioritizes communal responsibility or in one that believes in an omniscient, omnipotent, vengeful deity.</p>
<p>Hormones, neurotransmitters, and how they are affected by your current and historical circumstances—these are the only things that determine how you will act and what decisions you will make at those inflection points when you're called upon to make impactful choices. And all of them are things you did not choose and cannot control.</p>
<p>Sapolsky, a neurobiologist at Stanford University, is not averse to the notion of our having free will; it’s just that he can’t find it. And he’s looked everywhere. He has studied—intensely—not only neurobiology but also endocrinology, behavioral science, philosophy, primatology, criminology, psychiatry, sociology, anthropology, evolution, and history. Not a single one of these disciplines precludes free will, but all of them together do. All there is to us is biology and the way that biology is affected by our environment. That’s it. We are not, as Yoda suggested, luminous beings; we are only crude matter.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982865#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982865&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>One of the most enduring mysteries within archaeology revolves around the identity of Punt, an otherworldly “land of plenty” revered by the ancient Egyptians. Punt had it all—fragrant myrrh and frankincense, precious electrum (a mixed alloy of gold and silver) and malachite, and coveted leopard skins, among other exotic luxury goods.</p>
<p>Despite being a trading partner for over a millennium, the ancient Egyptians never disclosed Punt’s exact whereabouts except for vague descriptions of voyages along what’s now the Red Sea. That could mean anywhere from southern Sudan to Somalia and even Yemen.</p>
<p>Now, according to a <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87513">recent paper</a> published in the journal eLife, Punt may have been the same as another legendary port city in modern-day Eritrea, known as Adulis by the Romans. The conclusion comes from a genetic analysis of a baboon that was mummified during ancient Egypt’s Late Period (around 800 and 500 BCE). The genetics indicate the animal originated close to where Adulis would be known to come into existence centuries later.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982985#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982985&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>

<p>For the third consecutive year, kindergartners across the US have fallen short of reaching the protective threshold of 95 percent vaccination coverage, and vaccine exemptions have reached an all-time high of 3 percent, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7245a2.htm">according to a new study led by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
<p>In the 10 years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination coverage among US kindergartners hovered around the target of 95 percent. But amid the health crises, vaccination rates slipped to 94 percent in the 2020–2021 school year, then to 93 percent in the 2021–2022 school year. For the 2022–2023 school year, overall coverage remained around 93 percent, but exemptions rose to 3 percent, up from 2.6 percent in the previous year. The current exemption rate is the highest ever recorded for the country.</p>
<p>The study, published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, included reported data from 49 states and the District of Columbia. Montana did not report vaccination data to the CDC.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983182#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983182&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>
