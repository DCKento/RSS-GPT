<div> Keywords: malicious software, DNS lookup, connection, NDR tool, network traffic

Summary:
Malicious software installed on computers often "calls home" by initiating connections, some of which can be detected through DNS lookup. However, some malware can initiate connections without DNS lookup, which is an abnormal behavior that can be identified by Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools analyzing network traffic over at least a two-week period. This abnormal behavior can be a key indicator of malicious activity on a network and can help organizations identify and mitigate security threats. NDR tools play a crucial role in detecting and responding to such threats by monitoring and analyzing network traffic for unusual patterns or behaviors. By leveraging the capabilities of NDR tools, organizations can strengthen their cybersecurity defenses and protect their network infrastructure from potential cyber attacks. Deploying NDR solutions as part of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy can provide valuable insights into potential threats and help organizations respond quickly and effectively to protect their sensitive data and systems. <br><br>Summary: Malicious software often initiates connections that can be detected through DNS lookup, but abnormal connections without DNS lookup can be identified by NDR tools, which play a crucial role in detecting and responding to cybersecurity threats. <div>
<p>Malicious software pieces installed in computers call home. Some of them can be noticed because they perform DNS lookup and some of them initiates connection without DNS lookup. For this last option, this is abnormal and can be noticed by any Network Detection and Response (NDR) tool that reviews the network traffic by at least two weeks.</p>

<title>State of Maine data breach impacts 1.3 million people</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Maine, data breach, cybercriminals, personal information, credit monitoring <br>
The State of Maine suffered a data breach affecting around 1.3 million people, compromising personal data including names, Social Security numbers, and medical information. The breach occurred through a known vulnerability in the file transfer service used by the state. The stolen data varied from person to person, impacting multiple state agencies. Progress Software, the provider of the transfer service, released a patch for the vulnerability after the breach. Maine encourages affected individuals to contact a dedicated call center to determine if their data was involved and to receive complimentary credit monitoring services if their Social Security Number or taxpayer identification number was compromised. Furthermore, individuals are cautioned to be wary of scammers posing as the State of Maine and should verify the authenticity of any communication regarding the breach. <br><br>Summary: The State of Maine experienced a significant data breach impacting 1.3 million people, compromising a range of personal information including Social Security numbers and medical data. The breach exploited a known vulnerability in a state-used transfer service, and affected individuals are urged to contact a dedicated call center for support and complimentary credit monitoring services. It is essential for individuals to remain vigilant against potential scammers and phishing attempts in the wake of the breach. <div>
<p>The US State of Maine says it has <a href="https://www.maine.gov/moveit-global-data-security-incident/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">suffered a data breach</a> impacting around 1.3 million people. According to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/ME/PST045222" rel="noopener" target="_blank">census from July 2022, that’s more or less the the entire population of Maine</a>.</p>
<p>The State of Maine says it was compromised via a known vulnerability in secure transfer service <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/06/update-now-moveit-transfer-vulnerability-actively-exploited" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MOVEit Transfer</a>. This vulnerability is known to be used by the <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/06/cl0p-ransomware-gang-claims-first-victims-of-the-moveit-vulnerability" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cl0p ransomware gang</a>.</p>
<p>The type of stolen data varies from person to person, likely because the data breach affected multiple agencies in the State. More than 50% of the data exposed in the breach came from Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services, while between 10 and 30% came from the state’s Department of Education. The breach also impacted several other departments.</p>
<p>For what we can gather, the cybercriminals may have obtained names, Social Security numbers (SSN), dates of birth, driver’s licenses, state identification numbers, and taxpayer identification numbers. The stolen data may involve certain types of medical information and health insurance for some individuals.</p>
<p>Progress Software, who make MOVEit Transfer, issued a patch for the exploited vulnerability on May 31, 2023. However, the State of Maine says the cybercriminals gained access and started downloading files between May 28 and 29, 2023, before the patch was available.</p>
<h3><strong>Data breach</strong></h3>
<p>The State of Maine is encouraging people to contact Maine’s dedicated call center to find out if their data was involved or if they have questions about this incident. The phone number is (877) 618-3659, with representatives available from Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 9 PM ET.</p>
<p>If your Social Security Number or taxpayer identification number is involved, the call center will provide you with a complimentary credit monitoring code which give you two years of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.</p>
<p>If you suspect your data has been stolen, it’s worth watching out for people posing as the State of Maine. There’s nothing like a data breach to bring out the scammers, and they will be looking to target people affected by the breach. If someone does contact you, make sure to verifying they are who they say they are using another communication channel. Watch out for phishing emails, too. </p>
